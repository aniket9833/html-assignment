Comments in HTML serve the purpose of providing explanatory notes within the code. They are ignored by web browsers and are not visible to users when the web page is displayed. Comments are useful for developers to annotate the HTML code, explaining its structure, providing reminders, or temporarily disabling certain parts of the code for testing purposes. Comments enhance code readability, collaboration among developers, and maintenance of the web page. They are created using `<!--` to start the comment and `-->` to end it.
